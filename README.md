# Drone that fits inside backpack, so you no longer need to carry those big, unpractical backpacks.

This mod contains BLUEFOR, OPFOR and INDEPENDENT versions of AR-2, AL-6 drones and Remote Designator.
To place this drone, you need to have item AR-2 (portable) or AL-6 (portable) or Remote Designator (portable), which you can find in virtual arsenal under misc items and Portable drone battery, which is under magazines. Remote Designator does not use batteries, so you don't need to have Portable drone battery in your inventory.

If you don't have battery in inventory, the drone will be placed without fuel.
To pick up the drone you need to use Ace interaction menu on drone and then select pick up drone.

If you want to check the battery status, which is inside the drone, you need to use ace interaction menu and select check battery.
